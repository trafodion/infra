  Description : Simplify interaction with Swift to upload and download files.

  Usage: $PRGNAME <OPTIONS>

  Options :
    -b                                          Use Backup Container
    -c                                          Use CDN Container
    -l                                          List files in container in Object Storage
    -s <subdirectory>                           Container subdirectory.
                                                NOTE: Only used in combination with -l or -d option.
    -u <filename>                               Upload file to container in Object Storage
    -d <swiftfile>                              Download file from container in Object Storage
                                                NOTE: if <swiftfile> is ALL then -s option must be set
    -o <outputfile>                             Output file name. 
                                                NOTE: Only used in combination with -d option.
