Thank you for your first contribution to Trafodion.

 Your patch will now be tested automatically by the Trafodion testing frameworks.
 Once the automatic tests pass, it will be reviewed by other friendly developers. 
 They will give you feedback and may require you to refine it.  People seldom get 
 their patch approved on the first try, so don't be concerned if requested to make 
 corrections. Feel free to modify your patch and resubmit a new change-set.

 Patches usually take 3 to 7 days to be reviewed so be patient and be available 
 to ask and answer questions about your work. The more you participate in the 
 community the more rewarding it is for you. You may also notice that the more you 
 get to know people and get to be known, the faster your patches will be reviewed 
 and eventually approved. Get to know others and become known by doing code reviews: 
 anybody can do it, and it's a great way to learn the code base.

 Thanks again for supporting Trafodion, we look forward to working with you.
